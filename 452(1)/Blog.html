                        <p style="font-size:150%;">summarize:Cloud storage is a technology that stores data in the cloud, allowing users to access and manage data over the Internet. It provides flexible, scalable storage solutions for both individual and enterprise users. Cloud storage offers several advantages, such as ease of access, robust backup and recovery mechanisms, and cost effectiveness. This article describes the features, application scenarios, and usage techniques of cloud storage in detail.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">Advantage:Scalability: Cloud storage can be flexibly expanded according to users' data requirements without the need to purchase additional hardware devices.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">Flexibility: Users can choose different storage types and service levels according to their needs to achieve higher flexibility.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">Easy access: Since cloud storage is Internet-based, users can access data stored in the cloud from anywhere, as long as there is an Internet connection.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">Backup and recovery: Cloud storage services usually provide powerful backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data security and integrity.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">Cost effective: Cloud storage service providers typically price on demand, and users only pay for the resources they actually use, reducing upfront investment and maintenance costs.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">Security: Cloud storage services typically provide advanced security measures such as data encryption, multi-factor authentication, and access control.</p>

                        <h1 style="font-size:200%;">Analysis of market status and development prospects of China's cloud storage industry in 2021 The market size may exceed 180 billion yuan in the next five years</h1>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">The development of China's cloud storage industry can be traced back to 2007, and the concept of cloud computing and cloud storage began to appear in China. In 2011, the concept of cloud computing and cloud storage was implemented; In 2012, the state listed cloud computing as a strategic emerging industry, major Internet companies have launched their own cloud storage applications, like Dropbox and Evernote applications are endless. The development of cloud storage in this stage is mainly based on the development of personal cloud storage.
                            In 2016, the tightening of regulatory policies led to the closure of a large number of online disk enterprises, resulting in a sharp decline in the scale of personal cloud storage users. Enterprise cloud storage ushered in a period of rapid development, and the state actively encourages enterprises to cloud. At the same time, with the growth of massive data, the market has put forward higher requirements for the security of information storage, and major enterprises have launched storage disaster recovery, dedicated enterprise storage and other services.
                            From the overall market size, the size of China's cloud storage market was about 11.5 billion yuan in 2015, and the size of China's cloud storage market has reached 32.6 billion yuan in 2019. In 2020, the continuous growth of massive data has further promoted the demand for cloud storage in China's enterprises, and the size of China's cloud storage market is expected to be close to 40 billion yuan in 2020.</p>

                        <h1 style="font-size:200%;">20 days continuous pressure test, which cloud storage performance is stronger?</h1>
                        <p style="font-size:150%;">Under the cloud storage category, two major cloud manufacturers currently offer the following products:
                            Block storage (Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud),
                            File storage (Alibaba Cloud),
                            Object storage (Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud),
                            Content distribution network (Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud),
                            Form Storage (Alibaba Cloud),
                            Archive Storage (Alibaba Cloud),
                            It can be seen that Ali Cloud's cloud storage product categories are more abundant, and the advantages of cloud computing pioneers are prominent.
                            Of the above six products, I have compared object storage last time. Content delivery network (CDN) testing takes an unusually long time, requires a large amount of data to make meaningful comparisons, and no automated tools have been found, so testing a CDN is not considered at this time (welcome to recommend tools that can automate CDN performance).
                            Then the only product that the remaining two offer is Block Storage. Block storage, simply put, is to provide a block device storage interface, a hard disk is a block device. In the products provided by cloud manufacturers, the so-called ordinary cloud disk, efficient cloud disk, SSD cloud disk, are block storage devices.</p>
